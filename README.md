# Overview

# Technical Choices and Reasoning
## Architectural
## Trade-Offs
## CircleCI
CircleCI was used in this project for these reasons:
* To automatically verify this project worked on machines other than my development machine. 
* To automatically verify master has all of it's automated tests passing.
* To demonstrate some ability to work with modern CI/CD pipelines.

## Known Issues 
* This project was initially intended to be available as a Gem for other ruby projects to use, however this functionality was not completed and there are a number of currently useless files related to this, such as `gemspec`, `version.rb`, etc. 
* The `reverse/polish/suray/` file structure is currently overly nested, but is related to the initial goal of making the project available as a Gem.
